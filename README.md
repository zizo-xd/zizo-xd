I'm a 1st year pursuing a Barchelor's degree in Information System 🎓 from University of São Paulo. I'm very passionate about technology and also willing to learn and work with many different types of technologies and domains 💡. I want to use them as tools to solve real-life problems ✨. I want to become a fullstack developer and always improve 👨‍💻.
